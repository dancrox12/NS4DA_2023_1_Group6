1177711341819138048,2019-09-27 22:27:19+00:00,b'@TheArtOfMakeup We had a wonderful time making Bojack. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more proud. Fell in love with these characters just like everyone else did but sadly Netflix thought it was time to close the curtains and so here we are. They gave us a home for 6 beautiful years. Nothing we could do about it.'
